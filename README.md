# Project Title:

### Window Kill Game Server - Phase 3

# Description:

### This project represents the server-side component of the Window Kill game simulation, developed using Java Swing. 
### This phase focuses on implementing the server to handle both online multiplayer and offline single-player gameplay. 
### The server manages player connections, game state synchronization, and communication using TCP and UDP protocols.

# Main Features:

### Multiplayer Support: Handles connections from multiple clients, enabling real-time online multiplayer gameplay.
### Single Player Mode: Supports offline single-player gameplay with local game management.
### Java Reflection: Utilizes reflection to dynamically manage game objects and behaviors at runtime.
### TCP & UDP Protocols: Implements TCP for reliable communication and UDP for real-time updates.
### Server Management: Manages client connections, game state updates, and network communication.

# Technologies Used:

### Java
### Java Swing for GUI components and game rendering.
### Java Reflection for dynamic class handling.
### Network programming with TCP and UDP for multiplayer interactions.
### Event handling for managing connections and game state.
